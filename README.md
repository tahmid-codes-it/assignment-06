<!-- 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
ans: var, let, and const
var → Old way. Can be used anywhere, not very safe.
let → Modern way. Stays only inside the block {} we wrote it in. We can change its value later.
const → Like let, but we cannot change the value after setting it.




2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
ans: forEach() → Just runs something for every item. Doesn’t give a new array.
map() → Runs something for every item and makes a new array with the results.
filter() → Runs something for every item and keeps only the items that pass the test.




3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
ans: Arrow functions are just a shorter way to write functions.
Normal Function:
function hello() {
  return "Hello! I am Tahmid";
}
Arrow Function:
const hello = () => "Hello! I am Tahmid";




4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
ans: Destructuring means taking values out of arrays or objects quickly.




5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation? 
ans: Template literals use backticks (`) instead of quotes.
They make adding variables inside strings easier.
exammple:
const name = "Tahmid";
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
